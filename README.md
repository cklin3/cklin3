- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cklin3
This is a dedicated account for the data visualization-related contents. Since my original account already hosting a
Github.io page that I wish to keep. This account will aslo be used as an student account to hand-in in-course project
or regular assignment. So stay tuned. Though I'm still a novice to data-visaulization, I will get better at this.
